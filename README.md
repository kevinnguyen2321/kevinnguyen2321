# About Me

Hi! I'm a software developer with a passion for building projects and collaborating in team environments. I thrive on the challenge of turning ideas into functional applications and enjoy learning new technologies along the way. I find the process of solving problems and creating solutions incredibly rewarding. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I always strive to write clean, efficient, and maintainable code.

I’m especially interested in full-stack development, where I can leverage both my front-end and back-end skills to create complete, user-friendly applications.
